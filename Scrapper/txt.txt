Web scraping
Selenium web driver is used for data harvesting in this module. 
A ChromeDriver executable, which is the same version as Google Chrome being used, is required. Download from https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads . 
The path to the executable should be specified in the wescraping python code. 
In this project, all the requested images are downloaded by navigating through the webpage in Google Chrome. 
A list of names of the image files is maintained and can be updated per the userâ€™s request.
Every time web scraping is performed all the images in the list are downloaded from the web and replace the old image files if any.
